\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The introduction should lead the reader to the work you've done. You should
% start with general statements and then get close to the core (zoom in). Every
% computer scientist should be able to understand what is paper is about. The
% introduction should follow the same structure as the abstract; but this time
% you should spend one paragraph for each item.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% (1) What is the problem? Motivation: broadly, what is problem area,
% why important? Open up the subject (the subject will be electromagnetic
% fields in cylindrical dielectric geometrics, adaptive arrays in packet radio,
% or whatever.)
% Introduce problem, outline the solution; the statement of the problem should
% include a clear statement why the problem is important (or interesting). In
% the case of a conference, make sure to cite the work of the PC co-chairs and
% as many other PC members as are remotely plausible, as well as from anything
% relevant from the previous two proceedings. In the case of a journal or
% magazine, cite anything relevant from last 2-3 years or so volumes. Avoid
% stock and cliche phrases such as "recent  advances in XYZ" or anything
% alluding to the growth of the Internet. Be sure that the introduction lets
% the reader know what this paper is about, not just how important your general
% area of research is. Readers won't stick with you for three pages to find out
% what you are talking about.
% The introduction must motivate your work by pinpointing the problem you are
% addressing and then give an overview of your approach and/ or contributions
% (and perhaps even a general description of your results). In this way, the
% intro sets up my expectations for the rest of your paper -- it provides the
% context, and a preview. Repeating the abstract in the introduction is a waste
% of space.

% naive approaches fail?) Narrow down: what is problem you specifically
% consider? Describe the problem addressed in this paper.

% does mine differ?

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We give a brief overview of
related work in the context of CHANGEME
in \sectionname~\ref{sec:relatedwork}. In \sectionname~\ref{sec:problem}, we
state the problem addressed and the terminology used along the paper. We also
present CHANGEME. In the subsequent \sectionname~\ref{sec:analyze} the
CHANGEME is presented. The results obtained from CHANGEME is discussed in
\sectionname~\ref{sec:evaluation}. Finally, we close giving some conclusions
and considerations and describe future work in
\sectionname~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
