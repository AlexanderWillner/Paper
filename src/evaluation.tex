%This section presents the detailed results you have obtained. If the paper
%is theoretical, you might want to show curves obtained from your equations.
%If the paper is experimental, you will be presenting curves showing the
%measurement results. In order to choose the proper curves to present, you
%must first be clear what point you are trying to convey to the reader. The 
%curves can then be chosen to illustrate this point. Whether your paper is
%theoretical or experimental, you must provide a careful interpretation of
%what your results mean and why they behave as they do.

Evaluation: How does it really work in practice? Provide real or simulated
performance metrics, end-user studies, mention external technology adopters,
if any, and so on.
